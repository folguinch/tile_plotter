# Special cases:
#
# Axes resizing are special cases. They are defined for specific positions
# in the grid e.g.:
# xsize_factor01 = 0.5  will scale the xsize value of the axis located at row=0, col=1 by a factor 0.5
# ysize_factor11 = 0.6
# xsize_factor*1 = 0.6  will scale all the xaxis in column 1
# specific values take precedent over * values
